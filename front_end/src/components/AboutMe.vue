    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      During my computer science master, I had the opportunity to study a bit of
      everything around software development and computer engineering. Then
      during my 3 years work experience at Dassault Syst√®mes I was able to
      specialize in Web development, From front-end to back-end, With DB
      interaction, architecture, devops. Being the only engineer developing a
      Complete web app, I was able to master all the aspects of web development.
      During those 3 years I had few interns joining the team, I was able to
      speed up the development by training them and working with them on the
      development. I also had the opportunity to discuss with clients about our
      solutions, and was able to perform proof of concepts to convince them to
      buy our solutions.
